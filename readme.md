## Actual situation

By now, the application can receive messages and comments. Anyone can see all of the messages and the comments, too. 

## The purpose

The objective of this app it's to create one application on Laravel which allowed people to create messages with their names. This messages can accept likes and comments, such as the most famous social networks.

## Technologies involved

In the first moment, I'm just using Laravel to create some functions and Bootstrap to deal with the front-end. To the future, i hope to integrate with some JavaScript framework, such as Vue.js, React or AngularJS.
